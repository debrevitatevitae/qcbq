# Quantum Computing Bootcamp with Qiskit

This repository contains materials for the MSU-IBM Quantum Computing Bootcamp with Qiskit (QCBQ). The event takes place Friday, October 18 through Saturday, October 19, 2019. The MSU-hosted website for the bootcamp is [https://egr.msu.edu/qcbq](https://egr.msu.edu/qcbq).

## Contents

The main contents of this repository are the [tutorials](/tutorials). Each tutorial consists of a 30 minute presentation on a topic followed by a 45 minute hands-on programming activity with [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org). Slides (and potentially videos) of talks will be uploaded after they occur. The programming activity consists of a guided Jupyter notebook tutorial exercising concepts discussed in the presentations.

The four tutorial sessions are:

* [Introduction to quantum computing, IQX, and Qiskit](/tutorials/01intro).
* [Executing quantum circuits on (real) backends](/tutorials/02sim).
* [Superconducting qubits, noise, and decoherence](/tutorials/03scqubits).
* [Quantum applications and algorithms](/tutorials/04qaoa).

More details about the tutorials can be found at their respective locations. The [talks](/talks) directory also contains presentation materials for each tutorial.

## Intended audience

The intended audience for this bootcamp is upper-level undergraduate students through post-doctoral researchers/professors with some experience in (Python) programming. Knowledge of quantum mechanics and linear algebra are helpful but not required. No knowledge of quantum computing is assumed.

## Help

The [help](/help) directory contains brief instructions on the following topics:

* [Install dependencies](/help/requirements.md).
* [Setup Qiskit](/help/qiskit_setup.md).
* [Making virtual environments](/help/make_virtual_environment.md).
* [Using virutal environments with Jupyter notebooks](/help/use_virtual_environment_with_jupyter_notebooks.md).
* [Interactive visualizations with Jupyter notebooks](/help/use_virtual_environment_with_jupyter_notebooks.md).

Additionally, the following external resources may be helpful:

* [Python programming](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide).
* [List of quantum computing resources](https://www.ryanlarose.com/external-resources.html).
* [Qiskit textbook](https://community.qiskit.org/textbook/).
