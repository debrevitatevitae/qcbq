    "# The quantum version of a NOT gate\n",
    "In classical programming, a [NOT gate](https://bit.ly/2SmqonO) turns a 0 bit into a 1 bit, and vice-versa. The quantum version of a NOT gate is the X gate, often referred to as the [Pauli-X gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Pauli-X_gate). It turns a [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) symbolized in a [Dirac notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation \"Dirac notation article on Wikipedia\") _ket_ by $\\vert0\\rangle$ into a $\\vert1\\rangle$, and vice-versa. These $\\vert0\\rangle$ and $\\vert1\\rangle$ qubits are quantum states, specifically _computational basis states_, and they are the quantum counterparts of the classical 0 and 1 bits. The X gate also operates on quantum states that are in some combination, or *superposition*, of the $\\vert0\\rangle$and $\\vert1\\rangle$ computational basis states. To demonstrate the X gate, we'll create a simple quantum circuit with the [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) framework after we've imported the necessary items.\n",

The sphere on the left represents a $\\vert0\\rangle$ qubit, as the line & arrow points to the top of the sphere. Similarly, the sphere on the right represents a $\\vert1\\rangle$ qubit, with the line & arrow pointing to the bottom of the sphere.\n",

There are several other gates on the right side of the application with which you can experiment, even if you aren't yet familiar with them.
